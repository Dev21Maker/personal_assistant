## Overview

The Personal Assistant Project is a workflow automation tool designed to streamline communication and task management. It leverages the power of OpenAI's API to process messages and deliver intelligent, automated responses within a communication channel. With its modular and scalable design, this assistant can be adapted for various use cases.

## Features

- **Real-Time Message Handling**: Automatically listens to incoming messages on a specific channel.
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Processes messages through OpenAI Assistant API to generate intelligent replies.
- **Thread Management**: Creates threads for seamless message processing.
- **Multi-Response Support**: Handles multiple responses from the AI, processing and sending them iteratively.
- **Customizable Variables**: Predefined variables simplify customization and usage.
- **Scalable Design**: Easily adaptable to other communication workflows or platforms.

## Workflow

Hereâ€™s a high-level breakdown of how the assistant works:

1. **Superchat Listener**: Monitors incoming messages on the designated communication channel.
2. **Thread Creation**: Initializes a new thread and forwards the message to OpenAI Assistant API.
3. **Variable Setup**: Defines key variables to enhance usability and modularity.
4. **AI Response Handling**: Waits for the AI to respond and processes the response data.
5. **Array Creation**: If the response includes multiple messages, organizes them into an array.
6. **Iteration**: Loops through the array to handle and send each message individually.
7. **Response Delivery**: Sends the processed responses back to the communication channel.

Refer to the **blueprint** for the project for a visual representation of the workflow.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Access to OpenAI API.
- A communication platform supporting automation (e.g., Superchat).
- Basic knowledge of Python and workflow automation.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd personal-assistant-project
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure the environment variables:
   - Add your OpenAI API key.
   - Configure the communication channel credentials.

4. Run the project:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

### Usage

1. Set up a listener on your communication channel.
2. Test the workflow by sending a message.
3. View the automated responses generated by the assistant.

## Project Blueprint

The **blueprint** for this project visually illustrates the entire workflow, including the key steps and integrations. You can find it in the project repository under the `blueprint/` directory or refer to the visual provided above.

## Future Plans

- Integration with additional platforms (e.g., Slack, Discord).
- Advanced AI response customization.
- Support for multiple communication channels simultaneously.
